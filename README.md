# md2pptx
Markdown to Powerpoint Converter

**Note:** md2pptx only supports Python 3. So the installation instructions are for that.

**Usage:**

  `python3 md2pptx output.pptx < input.markdown`

or

  `md2pptx output.pptx < input.markdown`

Before you can use this you need to:

  `pip3 install python-pptx`

as this code relies on that Python 3 library.

(On a Raspberry Pi you might want to use `pip3` (or `python3 -m pip`) to install for Python 3.)

You will probably need to issue the following command from the directory where you install it:

  `chmod +x md2pptx`

I would also suggest you start with a presentation that references Martin Template.pptx in the metadata (before the first blank line). \
Here is a very simple deck that does exactly that.

```
template: Martin Template.pptx

# This Is A Presentation Title Page

## This Is A Presentation Section Page

### This Is A Bulleted List Page

* One
    * One A
    * One B
* Two

Here are some slide notes. Note you leave an empty line between the content - in this case a bulleted list - and the notes.

You can do multiple paragraphs and even use symbols.
```
